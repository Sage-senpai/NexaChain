00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:00.119
...

00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:01.479
the thing you had on the

00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:02.330
last slide, Nexa.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.265
Can you talk a

00:00:03.265 --> 00:00:04.219
little about that?

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:05.406
Ah, yes. So,

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:08.442
Nexa is a cryptocurrency that

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:10.631
we launched to explore, um,

00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:12.282
these different aspects of

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:13.529
cryptocurrencies that we want.

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:15.039
We don't have RISC-V

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.032
running on it yet. Ah,

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:17.020
we added registers.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.579
So, now,

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:18.779
our scripting language is

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.539
very similar to BCH's, ah,

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.319
but we added some

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:21.750
registers.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.546
And RISC-V is just an idea

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:25.410
that doesn't exist in Nexa yet.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.057
But what I think is really

00:00:27.057 --> 00:00:28.433
cool about Nexa is Nexa's proof

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:29.645
of work. So,

00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:31.959
what miners do in

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:33.887
Nexa is perform the same

00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:35.956
calculations that you need to do

00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:37.599
to verify a transaction.

00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:37.906
So,

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:39.345
Nexa's power basically

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:40.496
performs point multiplication

00:00:40.496 --> 00:00:41.000
on elliptic curves and queries

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.685
so, let's do that!

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:43.620
UTXO. So,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.127
to be a good miner

00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:45.730
of Nexa,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.634
you need to develop

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:47.237
the hardware,

00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:48.768
the same hardware we need

00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:49.952
to solve the computational

00:00:49.952 --> 00:00:50.880
bottlenecks of scalability

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.520
of cryptocurrencies in general.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.863
And that was my main motivation

00:00:53.863 --> 00:00:54.759
for working on this project.
